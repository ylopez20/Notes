## Access to the classroom portion of GitHub

The classroom portion has me set up assignments one at a time, and then share an invitation link to those in the class to take part.

The Link for the question, which is private (I am the only person who will see your answers) is: 
https://classroom.github.com/a/u_ojNnJz


Please go to this link and we will see how it work. 

Create a file that has your answer to the question of weather you would lke to have the handed in assignments be visible to the class.
